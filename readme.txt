### This document refers to Udacitys 'Nanodegree: Programming for Data Science' project 2: 'Explore US Bikeshare Data' ###

# Overview

# Information regarding the data for the program bikeshare.py:
To run the program the following csv data is required:
	- chicago.csv
	- new_york_city.csv
	- washington.csv
The csv data contains all bikeshare information for a specific city.

# Information regarding the program bikeshare.py:
The program bikeshare.py is built to analyze data for a selected city, month and day filter.
The data is filtered according to the user input and displays different information like most popular month.
Depending on the user input it is possible to filter the data and display the raw data that has been used.

# Information regarding the used Program, Language and Libraries:
Program: Spyder (Python3.9)
Language: python 3.9
Libraries: pandas, time

# Used sources for the project:
	- https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/		The pandas documentation helped me most of all to understand the correct usage of pandas.
	- https://github.com/sumankumarsubudhi/			The project by sumankumarsubudhi helped me with a different aproach on while loops which helped me reduce the needed code for most of my functions.
	- https://classroom.udacity.com/			The documentation and quiz+solution in the different parts of the nanodegree helped me to correct a few mistakes i have made.
	- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/			The GeeksforGeeks homepage helped me with a few specific problems i had and how to properly solve them.
	- https://stackoverflow.com/				The stackoverflow homepage helped me with a few specific problems i had and how to properly solve them.I also got a few helpful ideas on how to improve my code.
Besides the online sources i would like to mention that i discussed different approaches with my brother to see how a programmer with working experience would work on such a project.
The programming knowledge of my brother has been used specifically for discussing ideas, not to fullfil this project.
